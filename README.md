# Party Killer
Party killer is the second game I've made on Unity. It's about a room of people playing a party game. There is one individual attributed "killer" and every thime the lights switch off and on, he removes some people from the room. The point of the game is to find who this individual is by observing the people that stay in the room every round but change their locations. You have to mind the appearances of people and try to remember people who survive every round and through the later stages of the game you make a guess. You have 3 guesses in total. 

The game can be played on any pc browser from here:
